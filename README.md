   The project was used to show the amount of times something appeared on a grocery list. It would help prevent an item being added more then once or will count the times it is on a list.
2. What did you do particularly well?
   I believe that I wrote the code with the less amount of needed coding inorder for the file to pull a list and then output another list giving the frequency of items on the frist file.
3. Where could you enhance your code?
   You could have the ouput file list all items by its catorgeory.
4. How would these improvements make your code more efficient?
   It would show where the shopping list focus the most on to help stores set stores up to better help the shoppers.
5. what part of the code did you find challenging?
    I did not find any part of the coding challenging when writing it.
6. How did you overcome this?
    There was nothing to over come.
7. What skills from this project will be particualarly transferable to other projects or works?
    All of it could, from inputing a file. reading it, creating a useable menu, then outputting the file is all good things to use on other projects.
8. how did you make this program maintainable, readable and adaptable?
    I wrote comments on the lines as I did it to help anyone be able to know where what is, I aslo tried to use the best suitable coding method to write the code to make it easier.
